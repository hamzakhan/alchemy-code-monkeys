# T&J Fine Jewelry Application

# Project Description
  The T&J Fine Jewelry Application is where military families around the world can purchase jewelry products,
place special orders or return fine jewelry items including; diamonds, gemstones, bridal collections and sterling silver. 
The clientele are restricted to military personnel and families due to the competitive item prices and the exemption of sales tax.
The visual representation of our catalog lists products by categories.
Customers can then select items they wish to order and add them to the shopping cart.


  Before checkout the customer will be asked to enter their billing and shipping address as well as their payment information, 
which in turn will be stored in the database for future use. 
Returning customers will simply be prompted to log in before checkout.
There is also a login portal that T&J employees with appropriate credentials have access to.
Sales associates are only allowed to see and modify their own sales and commission records whereas sales managers have access to all sales records.
